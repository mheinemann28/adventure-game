ROOMNAME: Cat Kingdom
LONGDESCRIPTION: You start sneezing when you enter this room. It’s not very big, yet there are at least 25 felines wandering around the room, climbing on the cat castle, or napping adorably in this cat kingdom. A tabby cat saunters over to you and looks up expectantly. She starts to purr. But you are distracted by a roar. Not ten feet from you stands a male lion. You start to tremble with fear. Good kitty? To the east, there is a musty exit. To the west, there is an exit with bright lights.
