ROOMNAME: Cat Kingdom
LONGDESCRIPTION: You start sneezing when you enter this room. It’s not very big, yet there are at least 25 felines wandering around the room, climbing on the cat castle, or napping adorably in this cat kingdom. A tabby cat saunters over to you and looks up expectantly. She starts to purr. But you are distracted by a roar. Not ten feet from you stands a male lion. You start to tremble with fear. Good kitty? To the west, there is a musty door. To the east, there is an door with bright lights.
SHORTDESCRIPTION: You’ve entered the cat kingdom. A tabby cat purrs at your feet and a lion paces ten feet from where you stand. To the west, there is a musty door. To the east, there is an door with bright lights.

F2LOOK1: The lion notices you. It looks at you like a pork chop and starts to pounce. What do you do?
F2LOOK2: Impressive. There is a reason why lions are referred to as the king of the jungle, or in this case, the king of cat kingdom. Although he is now distracted by the catnip, you are still very nervous in his presence.
F2HIT1: Think twice before trying that, he would maul you.
F2HIT2: The lion rips the catnip from you and runs to the corner. He is now happily distracted.
F2OPEN1: Why would you want to do that?
F2OPEN2: Why would you want to do that?
F2MOVE1: That's not the best idea. Better off to avoid him, he would maul you.
F2MOVE2: That's not the best idea. Better off to avoid him, he would maul you.
