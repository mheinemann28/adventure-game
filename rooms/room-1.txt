A tennis ball rolls towards you and stops at your feet. On the opposite side of the court Serena Williams is lost in thought. Is she at practice? Is she waiting on her next opponent to appear through the door? In the northwest corner, there is an exit covered in animal hair. In the southwest corner, there is an exit blowing in fresh air onto the tennis court. Towards the east, there is an exit with a fluttering noise.
