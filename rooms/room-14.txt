You notice a rocking chair in the center of the room that seems to be moving on its own. As you creep closer you begin to see it, the ghost of an old man sitting in the chair. To the north, there is a door with a storage sign on it. To the east, there is a door with a live pig staring back at you. To the west, there is another door, but you feel confusion looking at it.
