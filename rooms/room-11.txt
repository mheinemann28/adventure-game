There is a skylight on the ceiling, but the sunshine from outside is obscured by years of grime. Off to one side of the room, there is an exhibit featuring a large book. The exhibit’s title is Book of Wallpaper. On the other side of the room sits an old man behind the librarian’s reference desk. He looks nearly as old as the book collection.
